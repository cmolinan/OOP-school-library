# OOP school library

> Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. This app allows you to:

* Add new students or teachers.
* Add new books.
* Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.
* And all of this will be built in a beautiful and well-organized way!

This BRANCH provides the Milestone #4: add basic UI
